Zero-Ology / Zer00logy

Zero-ology / Zer00logy & Void-Math: Symbolic Collapse AI Bot & Interpreter. Python-based cognition engine teaching metaphysical logic via Zero-ology & Void-Math OS. Simulates collapse states, dispatches AI prompts, and interprets constructs like: Ø⁰×∅=echo, 0÷0=∅÷∅, +0÷−0=ε⁻¹, ∞×0=8, E=c².0000, g=(m@void)÷(r²−+tu), t=e@(void÷tu)
